Edit History
"Undo" the most recent commit (keep your
working directory the same):
git reset HEAD^
Squash the last 5 commits into one:
git rebase -i HEAD~6
Then change "pick" to "fixup" for any commit you
want to combine with the previous one
Undo a failed rebase:
git reflog BRANCHNAME
Then manually find the right commit ID in the
reflog, then run:
git reset --hard <commit>
Change a commit message (or add a file you
forgot):
git commit --amend
